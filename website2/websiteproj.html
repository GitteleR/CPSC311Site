        <h1>How to Take a Screenshot on Windows</h1>
        <h2> This is going to be a simple tutorial on how to take a screenshot on a Windows PC.<br>
         There are multiple ways to take a screenshot on a pc with different apps but today I am going to show you one way to take a screenshot with an app that is automatically installed in your PC.</h2>
        <p>Windows used to have the Snipping Tool automatically installed into PCs. As of Windows 11, a new snipping tool is integrated into PCs. A shortcut was even added that makes taking screenshtos as simple and convenient as ever. </p>
        
        <ul>    
            <li>Step 1: Opening The Tool
                <p>In the past, you'd have to open an app to start the process of taking a screenshot of just a portion of the screen. Now it's much easier. On your keyboard, press down on the Shift key, Windows key, and S key all at once. (On a standard keyboard, these will be located at the bottom left.)<p>
                <p>Once you do this there will be a yellow border around your screen for a second and a horizontal taskbar will show up at the top center of your screen.</p>
                    <img src="ttproj/keyboard.jpg" alt="Keyboard"></li>
            <li>Step 2: Taking the Screenshot
                <p>After you hit the three keys, your cursor will turn into a cross. At this point, you can choose what portion of the window to screenshot. Hold down the left mouse button to create a box around the area that you want to screenshot. </p></li>
            <li>Step 3: Opening Your Screenshot with Snip & Sketch
                <p>Once you let go of the left mouse button, the Snip & Sketch tool will pop up a window to the bottom right. It is going to show a preview of the screenshot you have taken. Click on this pop-up to open the application.</p><br>

            <li>Step 4: Saving the Screenshot
                <p>In the Snip & Sketch app, either hit Ctrl-S, or hit the floppy disk icon at the top left to save your image. It will give the option of jpg, png, or gif. Give your screenshot a name and save to whichever folder you would like.</p></li>
        </ul>
